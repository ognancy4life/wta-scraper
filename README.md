# Washington Trails Association Web Scraper


## Description
> This is a project folder for a Washington Trail Association (WTA) web scraper.
> This web scraper gathers all relevant information for hikes listed on and under this sub-domain: 'wta.org/go-outside/hikes'.
> Then, all hike data is returned and formatted in a CSV file.
> Keep in mind that this scraper relies on HTML code published on the sub-domains of 'wta.org'
> Thus, any changes made to their webpages can cause this web scraper to fail.


## Getting Started
To view the hikes this web scraper extracts data from, visit [WTA's Hiking Guide](https://www.wta.org/go-outside/hikes).

To get started, simply run the **_WTA_Hike_Scraper.py_** Python script.

```console
user@machine:~/wta-scraper$ python3 WTA_Hike_Scraper.py
```
